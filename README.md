## Description

The motivation for this project was our love for RPG games and our nerdy backgrounds. Whether its for fun or if you need to create characters on the fly for your stories, this app is perfect. By providing a quick and convenient tool to generate diverse and intriguing characters with back stories, this app empowers users to overcome creative blocks and save time. We designed this app to offer a wide range of customizable race, backgrounds, and classes, ensuring that anyone can bring their envisioned characters to life with just a few taps. there were ups and downs throughout this whole project, one thing we learned quite quickly was to scarcely use our API resources as they diminish rapidly.

When you click the build new character button it will take you to the character form where you can personalize. You can give it a gender, race, class, eye color, and hair color. After all that you can click the Discover your character button to see the results!

## Credits

Firstly our instructors Ben and Max helped us loads. We would especially like to thank them for their help with the image generator API and the login functionality.

We used files from Module 14 activities as the starter for our project and adapted them to achieve the functionality we desired.

The following sources were used to help understand the way we have to implement the APIs we needed.

Chat GPT API- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRQH2CFvedY

Docs to help with the image API-

Leonardo- https://docs.leonardo.ai/reference/getuserself

The Next Leg- https://www.thenextleg.io/docs/v2/getting-started

The following stack overflow query and answer gave insight so that we could capture user input from our character form: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62341048/javascript-queryselector-for-select-element. This was used in our public > js > char-form.js file, lines 10-14.
